# Python Projects
This is project which generate the 3 character baby name while supplying the words to it as input.
The output is based on which kind of words supplied to it whther these are Vowels or consonants or both.
For executing the program one need to download the code which is well commented to just run it on either py charm or any notebook supported by Python. Thanks!!!
